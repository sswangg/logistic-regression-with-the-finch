# Logistic Regression with the Finch
 
Attempts to make the finch move forwards given only wheel speed data points and if those data points make the finch move 
forwards or not. If the finch succeeds, tap the finch on its light sensors and the data from that run will be recorded
as forwards data, and added to the training data. If the finch doesn't move or moves in a direction other than forwards,
shake the finch. Hopefully, the finch is capable of reliably moving forwards after a couple hundred runs or so.
